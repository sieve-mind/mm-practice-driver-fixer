# Motorsport Manager Practice Driver Fixer

The Motorsport Manager (MM) game has a bug which prevents some drivers being selected for practice sessions. The bug can be fixed by modifying up to three incorrect values in the MM save file. [Credit to the original poster of this fix](https://steamcommunity.com/app/415200/discussions/2/1482109512320472245/?ctp=2#c3561682880008852087 "https://steamcommunity.com"). This program allows anoyone to open the save file, fix the incorrect values, then save a fixed copy of the file with minimal effort.
